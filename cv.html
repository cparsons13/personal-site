				I am a University student currently studying at Dundee University seeking a part time job to help me get the professional skills I will need, so that after I finish my education, I can start down the path to my career goals. During the past few years, I have been able to grow my ability to get along well with others after becoming a regular setter for a regional volleyball team. This, mixed with regular dance training and the demanding nature of my subjects at school, has also helped me learn to work under pressure, especially by balancing all the aspects of my life well. I'm looking for a good starter job that can get me used to a more professional work environment whilst also being enjoyable.
